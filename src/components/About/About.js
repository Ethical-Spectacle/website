        <h1>Who Are We</h1>
        <p>Ethical Spectacle Research serves two purposes: Building a knowledgable tech community, and publishing research that establishes ethical precedents in software.</p>
        <p>We launched recently, so we're doing a big push of events. The first is our sustainability themed hackathon. We'll be hosting monthly hackathons, networking events, and competitions, so join our Meetup Group to stay up to date.</p>

      <div className="our-values">
        <h2>Our Values</h2>
          <p><strong>Responsible Innovation:</strong> We believe the cutting edge of tech holds solutions to age-old ethical challenges.</p>
          <p><strong>Community:</strong> Building an inclusive community and platform that brings attention to developers is at the heart of what we do.</p>
          <p><strong>Moving Fast:</strong> While we take safety, security, and ethics seriously, we fight against the narrative that these things mean slower innovation.</p>
